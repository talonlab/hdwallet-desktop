# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how **HDWallet** approaches data privacy when you use our project hosted on GitHub.

## 1. Data Collection

We do **not collect any personally identifiable information (PII)** or other user data by default. This includes, but is not limited to, names, email addresses, or other personal details.

If we collect any data in the future (e.g., through GitHub’s repository analytics or issue tracking), it will solely be for the purpose of improving the project and will be transparently communicated to users.

## 2. Third-Party Services

We rely on **GitHub** as our primary platform, which may automatically collect usage data through its built-in analytics and tracking services. Please refer to [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) for more details, as their data collection practices are separate from our project.

## 3. Data Usage

Since we do **not collect any data directly from users**, there is no user data that we analyze, share, or use for any purpose. If this changes in the future, data (such as error logs or anonymous usage statistics) will be used strictly to improve the software and enhance user experience.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do **not share any user data with third parties**. The only exception would be if required by law or if necessary to protect our project’s legal rights.

## 5. Data Security

As we do **not collect data**, there is no user data to secure. However, we strive to keep our repository and any associated tools secure using best practices. Please note that GitHub’s infrastructure security measures are separate from our project.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy as needed. If changes are made, we will notify users by updating this page with the latest version.

## 7. Contact Information

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at `contact@talonlab.com`.
